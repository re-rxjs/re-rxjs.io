This section assumes you have installed `@react-rxjs/core` and React.
See the [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) page for how to get started with
React-RxJS. Also, it's probably a good idea to have a look at the [Core Concepts](/docs/core-concepts)
page before starting this tutorial.

In this tutorial, we'll be building a simple todo-list application. Our app will
be able to do the following:

- Add todo items
- Edit todo items
- Delete todo items
- Filter todo items
- Display useful stats

Along the way, we'll also introduce the `@react-rxjs/utils` package, which is a set
of handful utilities that can come very handy when creating react apps.
